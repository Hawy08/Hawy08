**Important Notes:**

* **Skill Icons Shortcodes:** I've used common shortcodes for popular tools. Always double-check the [Skill Icons documentation](https://skillicons.dev/) for the exact shortcode if a particular icon isn't showing up or if you want to find more specific ones.
* **Categories:** I've split "Languages," "Major Frontend Tools," and "Web3 Tools & Blockchains" to keep it clear. You can adjust these categories as needed (e.g., combining them, adding "Cloud/Deployment" for Vercel/Netlify if still relevant).
* **Add/Remove:** Feel free to add or remove icons based on your actual experience. The more relevant and accurate, the better!
* **Other Web3 tools you might consider adding:**
    * `ethers`: `ethersjs` (a popular JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum) - *Skillicons might not have a direct icon for this, you might stick to general blockchain icons.*
    * `web3js`: (another JavaScript library) - *Same as above.*
    * `graph`: The Graph Protocol (for indexing blockchain data)
    * `chainlink`: Chainlink (decentralized oracles)
    * `polkadot`: Polkadot
    * `polygon`: Polygon
    * Specific Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or NFT marketplace protocols you've worked with.

This setup should give your `README.md` a very clear and visually appealing display of your expertise in frontend and Web3 development!
